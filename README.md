Once upon a time, an apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, and he discovered the laws of gravity. But was it only one apple ? Or a complete APPLE APOCALYPSE ?

For this sake, you will have the three (for the moment) best craftsmen of the world under your commands !


First, the gardener will supply the trees, which are necessary to grow apples. At a higher level, nests will be set up, and the birds' excretion are highly motivational for Isaac, when they fall on him !

Secondly, then engineer will develop advances technologies in order to optimize the efficiency of Newton's research :
- His comprehension of nature allows him to trigger catastrophies : interesting (and big) things will fall on Newton's head !
- The wheelbarrow enables to research even when God (you) is not currently playing.
- A powerful magnet attracts apples on Isaac's head... and much more !

The chemist improves the apple composition, shape, toxicity... without him, the world would be differennt (probably a bit more pacific, maybe...) :
- With a very powerful craft, he can make apples bounce on Newton !
- He can also create more treatening and harmful and evil apples, that will motivate Isaac in his work !
- THE APPLES EXPLODE and he can increase the number of particles that can potentially hit Newton !

Have fun !
